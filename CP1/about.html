      <h1>This page is all about me, Erik Nielsen</h1>
      <p>
        I am from Sammamish Washington and I went to Whistler during spring break.
        I am looking forward to learning to build websites more from scratch in CSE 154.
        If you're looking for my resume, that can be found
        <a href="resume.html" target="_blank">here.</a>

        If you have multiple favorites in a category, try a nested list inside of an li!

        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure
